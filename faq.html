                    <p class="question">What is this?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Dark Place is a open-source Deltarune fangame made in the Kristal Engine. It's roughly inspired by the r/place event that's held on Reddit during April Fools Day, both in concept as well as in namesake.</p>
                    <p class="question">Can I help out on this mod?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Of course! The project is open-source, so anyone is free to contribute to this mod. If you aren't really familiar with how the Kristal engine works, then there's definitely some other ways you can contribute to it. Whether it be through art, music, etc.</p>
                    <p class="question">Is there a story?</p>
                    <p class="answer">
                      Dark Place has a fairly simple story.<br> 
                      <br>
                      In this game, the legend about the Roaring introduced in DELTARUNE Chapter 2, turns out to be false for the most part, thus leading many people in the Light World to start creating fountains as they please.<br>
                      <br>
                      Unbeknownst to everyone however, one thing mentioned in the old legend still remains partially true. With the more fountains that are created, the more unstable things become.<br>
                      <br>
                      Susie, of whom had created MANY fountains prior to the events of the game, has created her 1000th fountain. Upon entering the world she created, she is then later greeted by an pelicular human that goes by the name of "Hero", who informs her about why too many fountains existing is still a major problem.<br>
                      <br>
                      So now Hero & Susie, alongside any potential allies they meet along the way, must work together to restore reality back to its original state.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p class="question">How did Dark Place get its name?</p>
                    <p class="answer">
                      Dark Place's name was created by AcousticJamm.<br> 
                      <br>
                      When the mod was first conceived, its original name was "Open Kristal Mod" initally. However, Brenda thought that name sucked ass, so they asked for any better suggestions.<br>
                      <br>
                      One of our contributors, AcousticJamm, suggested the name "Dark Place" as a joke about r/place. The others involved with the project at the time liked how the name sounded, so it just kinda stuck.</p>

                    <div class="trouble">
                        <p class="issue">Flowey appears when I boot up the mod and sends me to the Dogcheck screen. What do I do?</p>
                        <p class="resolve">
                          Most likely case scenario is that you were trying to play the mod on an older version of the Kristal engine.<br>
                          <br>
                          Since Dark Place is constantly changing, you'll either need the latest version or source code of the engine to play the mod.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="trouble">
                        <p class="issue">The mod crashes when I start it up.</p>
                        <p class="resolve">
                          That probably means someone did a oopsie in the mod's code.<br>
                          Usually though, errors like these tend to be fixed relatively quickly, so this shouldn't become too much a big issue.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="trouble">
                        <p class="issue">The DLC menu isn't working and I want to install a DLC.</p>
                        <p class="resolve">
                          We are completely aware that the DLC menu is busted, but we have a workaround.<br>
                          If you check the src/engine/vendcust.lua file, you should see a variable named GITHUB_REPOS.<br>
                          This variable is a dictionary where the key is the username and the value is a list of DLCs they own.<br>
                          From there, it's as simple as going to their Github profile and downloading the DLC manually.</p>
